## EncryptEase Password Management Suite 
## Information Security (CPE 4800) Final Project

Adapted from the JMongoDB Java Quick Start Project.

- Actual code: src/main/java/com/mongodb/quickstart
- Testing Encryption: src/main/java/com/mongodb/quickstart/encryptionTests

### Project Description:
General Topic: Developing an all-in-one password management suite that: 
1) securely stores and manages user credentials with advanced encryption and
authentication measures
2) incorporates a built-in password strength/entropy checker tool.

This suite helps users to protect sensitive data, evaluates the strength of passwords, and securely encrypts the passwords stored using either AES/TripleDES encryption for multiple users, ensuring robust security practices and streamlined password management.

Note: 
This project can currently only be interacted with by launching it and entering data through the console. This project's main focus is on implementing different Encryption algorithms. While this appl is functional and covers most edge cases, this app will not provide a seamless user experience.
